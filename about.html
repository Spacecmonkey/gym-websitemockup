            <h3>Owner</h3>
            <p>Brolin O'Connell is a fantastic gym owner who 
                has absolutly no expirence at all running a 
                gym and should never be in charge of a business
                 like this. However, for the purposes of this 
                 asignment he has become a thriving gym entreprenur,
                  and the first gym owner to ever wear a suit.
                  For this about page he decided to use his senior
                   pictures from highschool because those were the 
                   last professional photos he has had taken. </p>

            <h3>Lead Trainer</h3>
            <p>Logan is not a trainer he is Lawyer
                 that lifts too much in his free time
                  believe it or not. He fools a lot of
                   people because he doesn't really look
                    like a lawyer at all but he graduated
                     from Creighton, and works in aviation 
                     law. I wouldn't take my nutrition advice
                      from him but that choice is up to you! </p>
